h1. Fail console

This is a fun project made in a weekend. It uses socket.io, a private API (which uses Google translate, to generate audio voices) and some other cool stuff. It's a realtime text-to-speech chat-system, on a website and as an IRC bot.

h2. What's it for?

It's useless \o/

h2. What do I need to get this working?

* A lot of beer
* Node.JS, CoffeeScript and the modules that are in the top of server.coffee
* The private API is now private, because it isn't public... It's made by https://github.com/drblok - and he didn't published it yet.

h2. Screenshots
